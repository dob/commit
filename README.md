# Commit Dapp

This is a work in progress ethereum dapp which allows you to place a deposit against committing to a goal.
For example, you can pledge to commit to github 20 times in the next month, or run 5 times in the next week.
If you hit your milestone, you get your deposit back. You get paid out proportionately to how much progress
you've made. Any portion that's not paid out to the deadline gets donated to charity, with a small cut going to
the contract owner.

See contracts/Commit.sol for the logic.

*This is a work in progress, and isn't ready for prime time.*
